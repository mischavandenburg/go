This is my entire Exercism workspace. I'm working through their amazing Go track. The directories include the assignment files and the tests, but obviously those are not written by me and I'm including the MIT license in this directory. 

Every directory contains a .go file that contains my solution. For example, the "lasagna" assignment directory contains a "lasagna.go" file, which contains my solution to the assignment. All the other files are created by Exercism.

Exercism is amazing and I highly suggest you check them out.
